The purpose of this program is to help plan dinners (or any meals you need, really) by creating lists of foods you would
like to make.

TODO list:
Improve logic flow through option menu
Add some more basic modules like shufflePlan, findQuick, etc.
Eventually migrate to Java to create JavaFX GUI

shufflePlan: takes the list and plans out your meals randomly
findQuick: finds the three quickest meals to make
findBalanced: finds the most balanced meal according to cook/prep time, leftover nights, and number of ingredients
