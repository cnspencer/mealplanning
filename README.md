The purpose of this program is to help plan dinners (or any meals you need, really) by creating lists of foods you would
like to make.
You can run it by double clicking src/main.py or from the commandline with the following command from the mealplanning/ folder (you may find that the "3" on python is unnecessary if you have no other versions installed):

    python3 src/main.py main
Or by running in your favorite IDE/interpreter environment whatnot. The .idea/ directory has been provided for JetBrains' PyCharm.

# TODO list:
Add some more basic modules like shufflePlan, findQuick, etc.

Eventually migrate to Java to create JavaFX GUI

# Future Functions:
shufflePlan: takes the list and plans out your meals randomly

findQuick: finds the three quickest meals to make

findBalanced: finds the most balanced meal according to cook/prep time, leftover nights, and number of ingredients
